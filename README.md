# FantasyFootball
WPF FantasyFootball application

## Instructions:
Write a program that allows users to create and store footballers 
for a fantasy football team with the following characteristics:
- Name
- Goals scored
- Number of Yellow Cards
- Number of Red Cards
      
A menu should be output that allows the user to enter a new player(max 5),
view their existing team, see the team's current value, or quit the program.
The team scores 10 points per goal, -5 for a red card and -2 for a yellow card.

When calculating the team's value, the stats of each player is read from
the file and the stored values are used to calculate the current value of the team.
